This is a Word guess game created using JS constructors & inquirer. It runs in the command-line and displays:

An array of letters or placeholders depending on if the user has guessed the letter,  correct guesses, and remaining guesses.

A word is selected randomly from a list of 6 words and prompts the user to guess a letter. The user has 12 guesses until to complete the current word.

The words are 10 letters long.
